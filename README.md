## How to run the app
In the terminal type the following:
* npm install
* npm run watch
In addition, you need to create the file, named 'db.properties' in the resources folder. Then create tables, matched with entities, located in folder `/src/main/java/com/example/webapp/models`. After that, run the spring boot app.
